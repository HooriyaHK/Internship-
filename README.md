## Data Science internship in USAID - HANDS.
Utilized statistical tests (Chi-Square, F-Test) and machine learning (Random Forest classifier) to analyze disaster data
and predict disaster types.
Performed in-depth analysis to uncover patterns between disaster cycles and disaster types, providing insights for
disaster preparedness and response strategies.
Developed a Random Forest classifier to predict disaster types based on demographic and geographic data. Achieved an
evaluation of 85% effectiveness.
Provided actionable insights into the relationship between disaster cycles and disaster types, enabling more targeted
disaster management.
Demonstrated the feasibility of machine learning models to assist in monitoring and evaluation.
